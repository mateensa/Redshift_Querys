Amazon Redshift UDF's built-in scalar functions has following constraints:

Python UDFs cannot access the network or read or write to the file system.
The total size of user-installed Python libraries cannot exceed 100 MB.
The number of Python UDFs that can run concurrently per cluster is limited to one-fourth of the total concurrency level for the cluster.
For example, if the cluster is configured with a concurrency of 15, a maximum of three UDFs can run concurrently. After the limit is 
reached, UDFs are queued for execution within workload management queues. SQL UDFs don't have a concurrency limit.
